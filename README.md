# Mirai: The Future of Finance

# About Mirai's Technologies:
A repository for our senior project that is a web based mobile wallet. Will be developed in Python, Node.js with Typescript, and React.js. We anticipate the use of MongoDB as a backend database for the purpose of our website. Additionally, Stripe's API will be utilzied to manage USD Currencies. 

# What is Mirai?
It is a web based mobile wallet that will be available to be utilized on all devices from desktops to mobile devices. When developing Mirai, we emphaize three points: Simplicity, Elegance, and Security. Simplicity allows for a easy to use User Interface with a beautifully designed User Interface in mind as demonstrated by our Elegance principle. Arguably the most important principle is Security where we plan to make Mirai be as secure as possible given the recent spike in Cybersecurity related attacks in private and public sectors alike. Mirai will allow users to manage their own USD balances while also manage their own crpytocurrencies.
